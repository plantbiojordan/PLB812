# Lab 1: Data Formats & Databases 

In this assignment, we will download and format genome, annotation, 
and RNA-seq data from public databases and repositories. These data 
will be the basis of some of your future assignments.

## 1. Genome  

1. You will be assigned a plant species & dataset in class to work on.

2. Using the public databases discussed in Lab Lecture #2, download 
the genome fasta and corresponding gene annotations for your assigned 
species.
  
3. Upload these data to MSU HPCC.

4. If the files are compressed, uncompress them.

5. Take a screenshot of the downloaded files and the first 10 lines 
of each file. Rename the screenshot. Place these in the github 
repository PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment1  

## 2. RNA-seq data  

1. Identify the samples for your assigned dataset in the NCBI SRA.
 
2. Download the SRR files to the MSU HPCC.
  
3. Convert to a gzipped fastq format.
 
4. Take a screenshot of the downloaded files and the first 10 lines 
of only one of the fastq files. Place the screenshot in PLB812/
lab_assignments/assignment1  

## 3. Methods  

1. __Briefly__ describe the methods you used to download and convert 
the files for sections #1 & #2 in a text file named "methods.txt". 
__Be sure to list the accessions for the downloaded datasets.__
  
2. Place methods.txt in PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment1
  
3. Push your PLB812 repository to github.

D2L Email:
a. In the attached excel sheet I have assigned you a dataset. 
These are published RNA-seq experiments. Each one of you will 
be analyzing a distinct drought experiment with 3 control samples 
& 3 drought samples. Next to your name is the species you will 
using, the genotype, any notes, a link to the dataset at the NCBI 
SRA, and a link to the original paper. Download to the cluster the 
data assigned to you. As each of the datasets are part of a large 
study with multiple genotypes, you will need to locate the SRRXXXXXX 
number for the datasets you are assigned and download them. I STRONGLY 
recommend that you use SRA-tools (discussed today and in lab 
powerpoint) to accomplish this.

b. You will need to download the genome (fa) & annotations (gff) 
for your assigned species. I recommend doing this through Phytozome.

c. Upload screenshots as described in lab1.md to your GitHub repository 
for grading.

3. Lecture 2 is now available on D2L. 

4. Read the papers for next Monday.

5. I will be reading through proposal topics this week and sending 
feedback by early next week.
