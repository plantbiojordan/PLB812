Lab Assignment 6 Methods

1. I started by installing topGO and GO.db in R using BiocManager, then I imported ggplot2.


2. I switched over to my command line to create my topGO input file. I had to wrangle my
	files in a way that differed from the instructions on the slide (I have no clue
	why it didn't work for me... I checked 20 times for typos and it looked fine to
	me). I used mostly the same code you provided, but I used additional separate
	lines outside of the while loop to add commas between all entries, then replace
	the 1st instance of ', ' with '\t' on each line to create the .tsv format.


3. Once I got my topGO data formatted correctly, I created the topGO object 'goTerms'
	using the topGO function readMappings.


4. I read in my results table from lab assignment 5 which was created using DESeq2 and
	contained a column for differentially expressed genes.


5. I created a table of higher expressed genes by only keeping adjusted p-values below
	0.05 and log2FC values equal to or above 1.0.


6. I performed GO term enrichment on ontology Biological Processes by running the
	Fisher enrichment test and saved these results to two tables:
	
	a table of higher expressed BP genes with an FDR score less than or equal
	to 0.5, and

	a table of lower expressed BP genes with an FDR score of above 0.05.


7. I repeated the above step on ontology terms Molecular Functions and Cellular
	Components. 6 tables total were created (although they were saved as .csv
	originally, and when I tried to re-save them as .tsv sep="\t" but R did NOT 
	like that and added weird question marks to the file names).


8. I saved all 6 .csv tables to my assignment6/ directory and pushed everything to
	GitHub.
