Jordan Manchego's Methods for Lab Assignment #2 (PLB812)

1. The first thing I did was try to install fastqc using wget and unzipping that
	compressed file. That did not work very well (could only use fastqc commands
	inside the fastqc directory) so instead I activated my plb812 environment
	and ran the line 

	<conda install -c bioconda fastqc>

	and that worked like a charm.


2. To make sure it was successfully installed, I navigated into the directory
	with my fastq files and successfully ran the command

	<fastqc SRR5448192.fastq>.


3. Next, I tested my fastqc installation in my environment by submitting a very
	simple job script that, besides the necessary #SBATCH arguments and the 
	paths to my working directory and conda environment, only contained the
	line

	<fastqc SRR5448193.fastq>

	and it successfully completed.


4. Then, I wrote run_fastqc.sh and submitted it to the HPCC but this was not
	successful due to running out of storage. I will run the job script 
	again from my scratch directory to make sure I have all my files
	before we meet again for class next week.


5. Lastly, I deactivated my conda environment, exited the dev-intel14-k20 node,
	and logged out of the HPCC.
