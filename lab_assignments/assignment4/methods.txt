Jordan Manchego's methods for assignment 4 (PLB 812):

1. I installed HISAT2, samtools, and gff using conda install -c bioconda <package>

2. I converted the annotation file in my Phytozome directory from .gff3 to .gtf

3. I extracted the splice site (.ss) and exon (.exon) files from the .gtf annotation file

4. I built the indexes using hitsat2 and input my .exon, .ss, 2 .fastq (paired-end data) 
	files, and reference genome file

5. I used HISAT2 and samtools to generate .bam files for each pair of reads, saved each
	output containing alignment results in a text file

6. Finally, I used the output results to create the .csv table with information on
	total read pairs and unique read pairs
