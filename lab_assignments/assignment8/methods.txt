Jordan Manchego's Methods for Lab Assignment 8
PLB812 | November 16, 2022

1. I began by cloning the gatk repo from GitHub and downloading picard.jar from the picard 
	GitHub repo and saving both in the same directory as my A. thaliana genome .fa file 
	and sorted .bam file from assignment 7.

2. Next I tried to run MarkDuplicates but found I needed to sort my input bam file (again?)
	and StackOverflow recommend using a function within picard.jar that looked like
	
	java -jar picard.jar SortSam \ 
	I=aln-pe.bam \
	O=sorted-alnpe.bam \
	SORT_ORDER=coordinate 

	then I was able to run MarkedDuplicates using

	java -jar picard.jar MarkedDuplicates \
	I=sorted_alnpe.bam \
	O=marked_duplicates.bam \
	M=marked_dup_metrics

	which output marked_duplicates.bam and marked_dup_metrics.txt. I took a screen-
	shot of 'head marked_dup_metrics.txt' and placed this in PLB812/lab_assignments/\
	assignment8.

3. In order to run AddOrReplaceReadGroups I had to generate Athaliana.fa.fai and
	Athaliana.dict, which I only found out after running into errors with AddOrReplace-
	ReadGroups. I'm honestly not sure if I configured something wrong when I indexed
	the genome last week, but regardless, it didn't take long for samtools to
	create these two new index files. I ran

	samtools faidx Athaliana.fa

	and

	samtools index Athaliana.fa > Athaliana.dict

	to create the .fai and .dict files, respectively. The default output for samtools
	index is a .dict file, but I didn't see the file in my directory until I used >.

4. I ran AddOrReplaceReadGroups as shown below.

	java -jar picard.jar AddOrReplaceReadGroups \
	I=marked_duplicates.bam \
	O=addReadGroups.bam \ 
	RGID=1 \
	RGLB=lib1 \
	RGPL=Illumina \
	RGPU=NA \
	RGSM=WS2

5. Finally, I called the Haplotypes using

	gatk-4.3.0.0/gatk --java-options "-Xmx4g" HaplotypeCaller \ # I git cloned gatk
	-R Athaliana.fa \
	-I=addReadGroups.bam \
	-O=HaplotypeCaller.g.vcf.gz \ # I just wasn't feeling creative
	-ERC GUCF

	Then I took a screenshot of the first 20 lines of this file and placed it in
	my assignment8 directory.
