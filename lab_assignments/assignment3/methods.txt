Methods for Lab Assignment 3
Jordan Manchego - PLB812

1. I started by using a simple loop to open all the fastqc .html files so I could look at
	adapter content and sequence quality. The loop was:
	for thing in *.html; do open ${thing}; done
	
2. I found that only a few files showed any adapter content at all, with only a slight
	amount of that adapter, which was the Illumina Universal Adapter. I googled
	this to find the sequence and found that I needed to use AGATCGGAAGAG based on
	Illumina's website.
	
3. I wrote my job script so that it would loop through and perform cutadapt on all of
	the fastq files first, then a second loop would run fastqc on all of the output files.
	A third loop unzipped the results of running fastqc, and a fourth loop renamed the
	.html files of each unzipped file because they were all named identically. The
	fourth loop simply appended the name of the directory to the name of the .html file.
	
	I submitted this job script using the following line:
	sbatch cutadapt_to_fastqc.sb
	
4. I used cp to bring all of the output_*.html files to 
	PLB812/lab_assignments/assignment3/
